    "First, I looked over what public key encryption was. I heard of the term before, but didn't know what it actually meant. Through my research, I learned that it is a pair of mathematically related keys, including a public and private key (one for encryption, one for decryption). The public key is open sent out, but the private key is kept hidden and is used to decrypt the public key. This method provides a secure and safe method of data transmission. <br>\n",

    "Next, I touched up on my binary skills. I remembered a bit of binary from the last team teach in trimester one, but I'm going to be honest, I completely guessed on the binary question. To fix my mistake, I studied binary through \"Binary - The SIMPLEST explanation of Counting and Converting Binary numbers\" by \"practical networking\" on youtube, which really helped me. Now, when I come across another binary problem, I won't have the same problem of not knowing what to do. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, with the help of the team teaches, as well as my experience from the last mcq, I had a lot better and easier time going through the problems. I knew how to better deal with certain types of problems, how to strategically think about some problems to make my life easier, etc. On this test, I had no problem doing the data analysis, \"what code segment fits\", robot questions, as well as many others. I was really happy, as the concepts that I really didn't know anything about when I was taking the first mcq were all answered by the team teach. I understood basically almost all the concepts (digital divide, bits, ip, etc.) <br>\n",

    "To improve further on my mcq test taking, I still need to touch up on my binary skills, as well as just being more thorough with my question reading. I sometimes rush through questions, and I don't pay enough attention to realize that I read the question wrong."
