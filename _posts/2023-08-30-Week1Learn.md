Week 1:

VSCode: This week, I started using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). It's a cool code editor with lots of add-ons that make coding in different languages easier.

Python: I learned about Python, which is a beginner-friendly programming language. I figured out the basics like variables, types, if-else stuff, loops, and functions.

Jupyter: I tried Jupyter notebooks for coding with Python. It's good for doing data stuff. I saw how it mixes code and text in one document.

College Board Pseudo Code: I also learned some College Board Pseudo Code. It's like a step-by-step way of thinking to solve problems in computer stuff.

GitHub Pages: I found out how to make my own website using GitHub Pages. It's like a place to share my coding projects.

Student GitHub Pages: I thought about making pages for each student. They can show their work.

Python I/O: I learned how to read and write files, get user input, and show stuff on the screen in Python. It's important for coding.
